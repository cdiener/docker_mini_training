## Mini training

Here you find the materials for my docker mini training.
It consists of a short intro to docker followed by
a demo of the [cobrapy docker container](https://github.com/cdiener/cobra-docker).

### Installation

If you want to run the live parts yourself you will need docker installed on your machine. There are detailed
installation instructions for [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntu/),
[Mac OSX](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) and [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
on the docker home page. However, it is not necessary that you install docker
for the training, you can just drag along.
