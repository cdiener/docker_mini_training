## Mini training

Here you find the materials for my docker mini training from December 1, 2015. It consists of a short intro to docker followed by
a demo of the cobbrapy docker container.

### Installation

If you want to run the live parts yourself you will need docker installed on your machine. There are detailed
installation instructions for [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/ubuntulinux/), 
[MacOS](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/mac/) and [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/windows/) 
on the docker home page. However, it is not necessary that you install docker for the training, you can just drag along.
